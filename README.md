## PLEASE NOTE:

This is currently a work in progress. I am migrating to a new codebase that is open source (what you see now). Migrating
will take a few days, everything will be updated in this repository in the future.

Certain parts are omitted from being uploaded due to the nature of them (certain API links, for example).

Once this rewrite is done, a proper Readme will be made which explains the project, code, uses, etc.

Issues and contributions are always welcome throughout the whole development stage.
